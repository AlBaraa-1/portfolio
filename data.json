Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree, I've developed expertise in machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and image processing techniques. My journey began with curiosity about how computers can 'see' and understand the world, leading me to work on projects ranging from text classification models achieving 94% accuracy to real-time object detection systems.",
